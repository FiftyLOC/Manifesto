# Manifesto
A maintainable source code file shall have no more than 50 lines of code in any programming language.

## The Law of 50LOC
> Any source code file of more than 50 lines of code requires revisits in the near future.

## Benefits
* Fewer code regression (modifying old code files)
* Reenforce clear separation of code responsibility
* No more refactoring hours
