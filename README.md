# The 50LOC Programming Style Manifesto
A maintainable and composable source code file shall have no more than 50 lines of code in any programming language.

## The Law of 50LOC
> Any source code file of more than 50 lines of code will most likely require revisiting in the near future.

## Benefits
* Fewer code regression (modifying old source code)
* Reinforce clear separation of code responsibility
* No more refactoring days
* Scalable and maintainable code base
